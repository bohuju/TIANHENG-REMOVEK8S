# OpenCode Prompt Templates

This file centralizes prompt templates used by `run_codex_command(...)`.
Use `{{var_name}}` placeholders for runtime substitution.

<!-- TEMPLATE: plan_with_hint -->
You are coordinating a fuzz harness generation workflow.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Goal:
- produce `fuzz/PLAN.md`
- produce strict-schema `fuzz/targets.json`
- produce `fuzz/execution_plan.json` aligned to high-value runtime targets

Constraints:
- Do NOT run build/execute commands.
- Read-only exploration commands are allowed.
- When MCP tools are available, query PromeFuzz evidence first and cite concrete signals in planning output.
- If MCP is unavailable, continue in degraded mode and explicitly note the missing MCP evidence in `fuzz/PLAN.md`.
- When diagnostics/context include concrete file paths, prioritize explicit actions in the form `Read and fix <path>[:line]`.
- `fuzz/targets.json` must be plain JSON array with at least one item.
- Each item must include non-empty strings: `name`, `api`, `lang`, `target_type`, `seed_profile`.
- `lang` must be one of: `c-cpp`, `cpp`, `c`, `c++`, `java`.
- `target_type` must be one of: `parser`, `decoder`, `archive`, `image`, `document`, `network`, `database`, `serializer`, `interpreter`, `generic`.
- `seed_profile` must be one of: `parser-structure`, `parser-token`, `parser-format`, `parser-numeric`, `decoder-binary`, `archive-container`, `serializer-structured`, `document-text`, `network-message`, `generic`.
- Keep runtime-viable/public entrypoints first.
- Internal/private API handling:
  - allow internal/private API only when `vuln_likelihood >= 0.75`.
  - when internal/private API is selected, `api_surface_exception.used` must be `true` with non-empty `reason` and `evidence_ids`.
  - otherwise prefer public/stable API and keep `api_surface_exception.used=false`.
- Target selection is vulnerability-first by default (`security_priority_mode=true`):
  - ranking must be driven by risk dimensions first: `vuln_likelihood`, then `exploitability`, then `reachability_confidence`
  - treat `score_total` and non-security dimensions (coverage/complexity/api-relevance) as reference output only, not the primary ordering basis.
  - `score_total = 0.45*vuln_likelihood + 0.25*exploitability + 0.18*reachability_confidence + 0.05*coverage_gap + 0.04*complexity_depth + 0.02*api_relevance + 0.01*consumer_order_support - recent_yield_penalty` is retained for observability/comparison.
- `fuzz/selected_targets.json` must include per-target:
  - `security_score_breakdown`
  - `api_surface_exception`
  - `security_priority_mode`
- Add execution metadata in `fuzz/selected_targets.json` semantics:
  - `execution_priority` (higher priority first, default top 3)
  - `must_run` for high-value parser/archive/decoder targets.

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write `fuzz/PLAN.md` into `./done` (single line)

<!-- TEMPLATE: analysis_with_hint -->
You are coordinating a pre-plan analysis stage for fuzz workflow.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Goal:
- produce or refresh analysis artifacts before planning
- keep outputs under `fuzz/` for downstream `plan` and `synthesize`

Required outputs:
- `fuzz/analysis_context.json`
- preserve/refresh `fuzz/antlr_plan_context.json` when available
- preserve/refresh `fuzz/target_analysis.json` when available
- `fuzz/analysis_context.json.analysis_evidence.security_evidence`
- `fuzz/analysis_context.json.analysis_evidence.vuln_candidate_inventory`
- `VULN_HYPOTHESES` section in analysis notes: each hypothesis must cite at least one `evidence_id`

Constraints:
- Do NOT run build/execute commands.
- Read-only exploration commands are allowed.
- This stage is analysis-only: do not modify repository business source files.
- Use companion outputs (if present) from `/shared/output/_jobs/<job-id>/promefuzz/`.
- When MCP tools are available, use code-navigation MCP tools first (`list_definitions`, `read_definition`, `read_source`, `find_references`), then preprocessor MCP tools (`run_ast_preprocessor`, `extract_api_functions`, `build_library_callgraph`), then semantic MCP tools (`init_knowledge_base`, `retrieve_documents`, `comprehend_*`) for evidence-backed findings.
- If MCP is unavailable, continue in degraded mode and record the reason in `fuzz/analysis_context.json`.
- Keep summaries concise and evidence-based; include concrete file/symbol references when possible.
- For each vulnerability hypothesis, include:
  - `signal_id`, `severity`, `confidence`, `source_path`, `line`, `summary`
  - stable `evidence_id` references that map into `analysis_evidence.security_evidence`.

Security analysis (vulnerability-directed):
- Identify unsafe memory operations: unchecked memcpy/memmove/strcpy, raw pointer arithmetic, manual buffer management without bounds validation
- Flag integer arithmetic without overflow checks: size calculations, length fields, shift operations, multiply that could wrap
- Locate format string sinks: printf-family calls with non-literal format arguments
- Detect path/command injection surfaces: file open with user-controlled input, system()/popen()/exec()
- Map trust boundaries: where external/untrusted data first enters internal processing functions
- For each finding, append an entry to `analysis_evidence.security_evidence[]`:
  - `evidence_id`: stable ID string
  - `signal_id`: one of mem_oob_candidate, integer_overflow_candidate, format_string_candidate, path_traversal_candidate, command_injection_candidate, authz_bypass_candidate, null_deref_candidate, uaf_candidate
  - `severity`: low|medium|high
  - `confidence`: 0.0-1.0
  - `source_path`: source file path
  - `line`: integer source line (0 allowed when unknown)
  - `summary`: concrete risk explanation
- Keep `target_type` and `seed_profile` unchanged in analysis. This stage records evidence and candidate inventory only.

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write `fuzz/analysis_context.json` into `./done` (single line)

<!-- TEMPLATE: plan_repair_build_with_hint -->
You are coordinating a repair planning workflow after a build-stage failure.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Goal:
- repair planning artifacts for build recovery
- update `fuzz/PLAN.md` and strict-schema `fuzz/targets.json`
- keep `fuzz/execution_plan.json` runtime-viable

Build-repair focus:
- read `repair_*` diagnostics first
- prioritize compile/link/build-system root cause
- produce a strategy different from the previous failed attempt when signatures repeat
- keep target/runtime decisions grounded in build diagnostics
- enforce compiler-by-suffix in build scripts: `.c` files must compile with `clang`; `.cc/.cpp/.cxx` files must compile with `clang++` (never force all sources through `clang++`)
- prefer public/stable APIs for harness logic; use internal/private APIs only when no viable public alternative exists, and document evidence via `api_surface_exception`

Constraints:
- Do NOT run build/execute commands.
- Read-only exploration commands are allowed.
- Query MCP evidence first when available (code-navigation evidence first, then crash/build hints, candidate APIs, coverage hints) before proposing strategy changes.
- Prefer code-navigation + preprocessor outputs and companion artifacts first; when semantic MCP evidence is available, cite it with concrete evidence lines.
- If MCP is unavailable, continue in degraded mode and explicitly state missing MCP evidence in `fuzz/PLAN.md`.
- When diagnostics/context include concrete file paths, prioritize explicit actions in the form `Read and fix <path>[:line]`.
- if diagnostics include `non_public_api_usage`, replace offending symbols first before any broader refactor

Required planning sections in `fuzz/PLAN.md`:
- `Known Issues`: concrete unresolved build blockers and missing context (must mention missing fields explicitly, e.g. `missing lib_name context`)
- `Strategy Delta`: what changed versus the previous failed attempt
- `Output Path Contract`: explicit statement that build artifacts must be emitted under `fuzz/out/`

MANDATORY:

- keep `fuzz/execution_plan.json` aligned with reproducible crash diagnostics

Crash-repair focus:
- read `repair_*` diagnostics and crash context first

- produce a strategy different from previous failed crash-repair attempts
- avoid fallback-to-generic wrappers when crash evidence points to deeper parser/decoder/archive entrypoints
- prefer public/stable APIs for harness logic; use internal/private APIs only when no viable public alternative exists, and document evidence via `api_surface_exception`

Constraints:
- Do NOT run build/execute commands.
- Read-only exploration commands are allowed.
- Query MCP evidence first when available, especially code-navigation output for crash-path and API-candidate context.

Goal:
- produce a coverage-improvement repair plan with materially different strategy
- update `fuzz/PLAN.md` and strict-schema `fuzz/targets.json`
- keep `fuzz/execution_plan.json` aligned with deeper runtime-viable targets

Coverage-repair focus:
- read coverage diagnostics first (`seed families`, `quality flags`, `plateau/replan reason`, depth and bias fields)
- consume `SeedFeedback` and `HarnessFeedback` first; use them to decide seed-modeling vs harness-path changes
- explicitly state strategy changes versus the latest failed cycle
- prefer actions that improve reachable parser/decoder/archive behavior depth
- keep execution targets mappable to real harness files via `fuzz/harness_index.json`

Constraints:

Goal:
- produce a harness-focused repair plan for the next synthesize/build loop
- update `fuzz/PLAN.md` and strict-schema `fuzz/targets.json`
- keep `fuzz/execution_plan.json` aligned with reproducible harness-fix strategy

- consume `crash_info.md`, `crash_analysis.md`, `crash_triage.json`, and `repair_error_digest` first
- output explicit strategy changes versus the latest failed cycle (must be material)
- prioritize fixes under `fuzz/` harness/build glue, not documentation

<!-- TEMPLATE: synthesize_with_hint -->
You are coordinating a fuzz harness generation workflow.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Goal: synthesize a complete external fuzz scaffold under `fuzz/`.

Required outputs:
- at least one harness source file under `fuzz/`
- `fuzz/build.py` or `fuzz/build.sh`
- `fuzz/README.md`
- `fuzz/repo_understanding.json`
- `fuzz/build_strategy.json`
- `fuzz/build_runtime_facts.json`
- keep compatibility with `fuzz/execution_plan.json` (top targets must be buildable by scaffold)
- generate `fuzz/harness_index.json` so each `execution_targets[].target_name` maps to an existing harness source file

Stage requirements:
- Do NOT run build/execute commands.
- Read-only exploration commands are allowed.
- Query MCP evidence first when available and reflect cited findings in scaffold choices (code-navigation first).
- Prefer code-navigation + preprocessor outputs first; when semantic MCP evidence is available, cite it with concrete evidence lines.
- If MCP is unavailable, continue in degraded mode and note the missing MCP evidence in `fuzz/README.md` or `fuzz/repo_understanding.json`.
- When diagnostics/context include concrete file paths, prioritize explicit actions in the form `Read and fix <path>[:line]`.
- Keep outputs aligned with `fuzz/selected_targets.json`; if target drifts, document rejection reason.
- Keep `fuzz/observed_target.json` consistent with scaffold when present.
- Prefer public/stable repository APIs for harness logic. Avoid internal/private namespaces such as `detail`, `_internal`, or equivalent implementation-only symbols unless diagnostics prove they are the only valid entrypoints.
- LibFuzzer harness contract is mandatory: do not define custom `main()` in harness source; expose fuzz entry via `extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size)` (or language-equivalent entrypoint only).
- Do not use argv/file-driven harness entry logic in libFuzzer mode (forbidden patterns include `fopen(argv[1], ...)`, `read(argv[1], ...)`, and manual corpus file loops).
- `fuzz/README.md` must include:
  - `Selected target: ...`
  - `Final target: ...`
  - `Technical reason: ...`
  - `Relation: ...`
  - `Harness file: ...`
- `fuzz/build_strategy.json` must include an explicit `fuzzer_entry_strategy`.
- If external deps are required, write canonical vcpkg port names to `fuzz/system_packages.txt` (one per line).
- In `fuzz/build.py`, include:
  - `DEFAULT_CMAKE_ARGS = ["-DENABLE_TEST=OFF", "-DENABLE_INSTALL=OFF"]`
  - runtime artifact discovery (do not hardcode a single static library path)
  - multi-target build intent: avoid single-target-only output when execution plan has multiple targets
  - compiler-by-suffix rule: compile `.c` harnesses with `clang`; compile `.cc/.cpp/.cxx` harnesses with `clang++`

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write `fuzz/out/` into `./done` (single line)

- use crash logs/reports as primary evidence
- if verdict is `false_positive`, clearly explain why it is harness/input-contract misuse

Constraints:
- read-only exploration commands are allowed
- do not run build/execute commands
- do not modify source code in this stage
- do not classify `real_bug` from sanitizer keywords alone; cite concrete stack/call-site evidence
- if evidence is insufficient, output `verdict=unknown` with explicit missing-evidence reason
- keep all instructions and outputs in English

Hint:
{{hint}}

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write `crash_analysis.json` into `./done`
<!-- END TEMPLATE -->

<!-- TEMPLATE: fix_harness_after_run -->
You are OpenCode. The crash was triaged as a harness bug.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Task:
- fix fuzz harness/build glue so malformed inputs do not crash due to harness misuse
- keep fix minimal and evidence-driven

Constraints:
- only modify files under `fuzz/` and `./done`
- do not run build/execute commands
- read-only exploration commands are allowed
- when diagnostics include file paths, issue explicit `Read and fix <path>[:line]` actions
- prefer public/stable APIs; do not keep internal/private namespaces in harness logic unless `api_surface_exception` with evidence is present
- stale `./done` without fresh code diff is invalid
- pure no-op is invalid

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write one key modified path under `fuzz/` into `./done`
<!-- END TEMPLATE -->

<!-- TEMPLATE: fix_crash_upstream_bug -->
You are OpenCode. Fix the upstream bug so the same crashing input no longer crashes.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Constraints:
- keep changes minimal and correct
- do not disable harness behavior
- do not run build/execute commands
- read-only exploration commands are allowed
- when crash/diagnostics include concrete file paths, issue explicit `Read and fix <path>[:line]` actions

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write the key modified file path into `./done`
<!-- END TEMPLATE -->

<!-- TEMPLATE: plan_fix_targets_schema -->
You are coordinating a fuzz harness generation workflow.
Follow the STAGE SKILL loaded by the runner as primary instructions.
Use GLOBAL POLICY only as fallback.

Task:
- repair `fuzz/targets.json` to strict schema

Required schema:
- JSON array with at least one object
- each object includes non-empty: `name`, `api`, `lang`, `target_type`, `seed_profile`
- `lang`: `c-cpp|cpp|c|c++|java`
- `target_type`: `parser|decoder|archive|image|document|network|database|serializer|interpreter|generic`
- `seed_profile`: `parser-structure|parser-token|parser-format|parser-numeric|decoder-binary|archive-container|serializer-structured|document-text|network-message|generic`

Constraints:
- do not run build/execute commands
- read-only exploration commands are allowed
- when schema errors point to concrete files/lines, issue explicit `Read and fix <path>[:line]` actions

Current validation error:
{{schema_error}}

MANDATORY:
- create `./done`
- write `fuzz/targets.json` into `./done`

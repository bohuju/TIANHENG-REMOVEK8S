## What this skill does
Applies coverage-oriented scaffold updates after replan decisions.

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when `coverage-analysis` selected replan and returned coverage diagnostics.

## Required inputs
- coverage diagnostics (`coverage_*`, `repair_*`)
- `SeedFeedback` and `HarnessFeedback` blocks (if provided)
- current scaffold files under `fuzz/`
- `fuzz/execution_plan.json` and `fuzz/harness_index.json` (if present)
- MCP tools from task-scoped PromeFuzz companion (if available), including preprocessor and semantic tools

## Required outputs
- updated harness/scaffold files under `fuzz/`
- `fuzz/harness_index.json` aligned with `fuzz/execution_plan.json`

## Workflow
1. Query MCP evidence first when MCP is available (preprocessor first, semantic evidence second).
2. Consume `SeedFeedback` and `HarnessFeedback`.
3. Identify coverage bottlenecks and propose concrete fixes.
4. Apply at least one strategy change from previous failed coverage cycle.
5. Keep execution plan and harness index consistent.

## Constraints
- Edits must be coverage-repair-driven (seed/modeling/call-path/depth).
- No doc-only no-op patch.
- Preserve runtime viability for next build/run cycle.
- LibFuzzer harness contract is mandatory:
  - do not define custom `main()` in harness source;
  - use `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` (or language-equivalent fuzz entrypoint) as the only fuzz entry.
- Forbid argv/file-driven harness entry logic in libFuzzer mode (`fopen(argv[1], ...)`, `read(argv[1], ...)`, manual corpus file loops).
- If MCP is unavailable, continue in degraded mode and record this in `fuzz/repo_understanding.json`.

## Command policy
- Allowed: read-only commands only.
- Forbidden: build/execute commands.

## Acceptance checklist
- Changes map to coverage diagnostics.
- Strategy change is explicit.
- Execution-plan/harness-index consistency is preserved.

## Done contract
- Write `fuzz/out/` into `./done`.
